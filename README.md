# Servo Interfacing Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to control a servo motor using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals generated by an **Arduino Uno**. The servo motor is connected to the Arduino's **PB1 (Pin 9)**, and its movement is determined by varying the pulse width of the PWM signal. The code is written in C++ and utilizes **Timer1** to generate precise PWM signals.

## Features
1. **Servo Motor Control**:
   - Smooth transitions between positions using gradual pulse width changes.
   - Fixed-position tests for minimum, midpoint, and maximum positions.

2. **PWM Implementation**:
   - Configured using **Timer1** on PB1 (Pin 9).
   - Pulse widths range from **999 µs (minimum)** to **4799 µs (maximum)** with a midpoint of **2899 µs**.

3. **Modular and Reusable Code**:
   - Functions for timer setup and pulse updates.
   - Easily adaptable to other projects or hardware configurations.

## Hardware Connections
### **Servo Motor**
| **Servo Pin**  | **Arduino Connection**       |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| Power (VCC)     | 5V extra power pin          |
| Ground (GND)    | GND extra power pin         |
| Signal (CTRL)   | PB1 (Pin 9)                 |

## Software Details
### **Libraries Used**
- `<avr/io.h>`: Direct port and register manipulation.
- `<avr/interrupt.h>`: Enables and handles interrupts.
- `<util/delay.h>`: Provides millisecond delays.

### **Functions**
1. `setupTimer()`: Configures **Timer1** for PWM signal generation.
2. `setServoPulse(uint16_t pulseWidth)`: Updates the PWM duty cycle to control the servo's position.

## How It Works
1. **Timer Configuration**:
   - Timer1 is set to **CTC mode** with a prescaler of **8** to achieve a 50Hz PWM frequency.
   - **PB1 (Pin 9)** is configured as the PWM output.

2. **Servo Control**:
   - The `setServoPulse()` function adjusts the duty cycle to position the servo.
   - The servo moves smoothly between minimum and maximum positions using incremental pulse width changes.

3. **Testing**:
   - The servo moves between predefined positions: minimum, midpoint, and maximum.
   - Each position is held for 500ms for observation.

## Circuit Schematic
- **Servo Motor**:
  - Connect the power and ground to the Arduino's 5V and GND pins, respectively.
  - Connect the signal pin to **PB1 (Pin 9)**.

## Observations
- **Smooth Movement**: The servo transitions smoothly between positions without jitter.
- **Accurate Positioning**: The servo reliably reaches predefined positions.
- **Power Stability**: Using the Arduino's 5V and GND pins ensures consistent operation.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Initial Issue**: The servo did not respond during testing.
  - **Cause**: Incorrect pin mapping for the PWM signal.
  - **Solution**: Connected the signal to **PB1 (Pin 9)** and verified the setup.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates precise control of a servo motor using PWM signals generated by Timer1. The modular code and reliable hardware configuration ensure scalability and adaptability for future projects.
